Code/Documentation/Mini Report: In lieu of a formal final report, you will submit a brief summary of what you accomplished, along with code and directions on how to use it. You can think of this as an extended README. You will be graded on the quality of your code and documentation (how easy is it for someone who doesn't know your project to run your code?).






In our project, we accomplished many of our goals through our implementations. 
We implemented rotations using matrix multiplication from class to rotate the elevator box in four directions. 
We also implemented 



Implementing expansive game logic to make our game work.
Implementing something we learned in class to rotate the elevator box (matrix multiplication).
Learned much more on how to use javascript, css, and html.




###### Getting Started

# How to run the game

1. Please download Visual Studio Code. 
2. Then open this folder in Visual Studio Code. 
3. On lefthand side bar, click on EXTENSIONS, and install Live Server. 
4. After installation, navigate back to explorer on sidebar, and right-click the game.html file and click "Open with Live Server" to open up the game in a browser.

# Directions + Controls

1. Use the up or down arrow keys to move the elevator up or down.
2. Use the left and right arrow keys to change the elevator direction. 
3. Each passenger has a specific origin and destination depending on the direction and floor, as well as a weight. 
4. If the elevator direction and floor matches the specifics of that passenger, press space to either pickup or drop that passenger.
5. The passengers located in the current floor number will turn orange to indicate their origin. Otherwise, the 
   passengers will appear grey to indicate their origin in a different floor.
6. You can pickup multiple passengers if the total weight is less than or equal to the weight limit of the elevator. 
   Otherwise, you can't pick up any more. The passengers will turn blue to indicate them boarding the elevator.
7. The player wins by transporting all the passengers before the time limit. Otherwise, the player loses. 
8. Once the end screen appears, the player can refresh the page to return to the menu screen. From there, the player can either retry or continue 
   and play another level. 
9. For clearer instructions, refer to the Elevator Game Manual.
